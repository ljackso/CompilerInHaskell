# CompilerInHaskell

Created Goal, a programming language which is based on a subset of features from Go. 

I then created a parser, compiler and virtual machine to run Goal programs. 

This was done for my dissertation in 2015 for my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham
